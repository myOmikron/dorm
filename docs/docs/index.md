# DRORM Documentation

DRORM is a multi-language orm (object-relation-manager).

It is heavily inspired by the excellent orm of the django webframework.

There are currently two versions:

- [DORM](dorm/getting_started): for the d programming language
- [RORM](rorm/getting_started): for the rust programming language
